I'm a recent Master of Science in Computer Science graduate who is passionate about developing softwares and blockchain technology to revolutionize our lives through technology and knowledge sharing. Currently, I'm looking for a position as a software developer or solidity developer where I can work with a company that is at the absolute bleeding edge of technological revolutions. In my free time, I enjoy learning new things and sharing my knowledge through Q&A forums in Stack Exchange.
